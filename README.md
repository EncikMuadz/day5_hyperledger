# Overview
* actually we are highly experienced in using this framework... but here it goes the summary from meetup...
* hyperledger consists of many products
* iroha, sawtooth, fabric
* sawtooth uses PoeT
* sawtooth is was initiated by Intel, hence why they are eager to use PoeT -> my view
* sawtooth can work together with EVM through Hyperledger Burrow
* sawtooth can work with web assemblies

# Feature we already knew
* private channel, in case of making select data private from competitor

# Idea
* one solution making use majority of hyperledger product

# Challenges
* data residency issues
* right to forget
* PDA
* AML
* KYC

# Use case
* Fabric - Medical (Change Healthcare)
* Fabric - Supply Chain (food) (Walmart)

# Food for thought
Is there a tradeoff of some kind (data transfer latency, efficiency etc) to achieve data security with blockchain's decentralized approach vs centralized data server approach?
